# code base to explain the errors in python

"""
Error in Python can be of two types i.e. Syntax errors and Exceptions.
Errors are the problems in a program due to which the program will stop the execution.
On the other hand, exceptions are raised when some internal events occur which changes the normal flow of the program.

"""
Syntax Error: As the name suggests this error is caused by the wrong syntax in the code.
It leads to the termination of the program.
